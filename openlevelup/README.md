Read-me
-------

OpenLevelUp! is a web viewer for indoor data from the [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) project.
It allows you to see inside buildings, level by level through your web browser. This is written in JavaScript.
The data is retrieved from OpenStreetMap using [Overpass API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API).

A live demo is available at [github.pavie.info/openlevelup](http://github.pavie.info/openlevelup/).

------------

If you want to install your own OpenLevelUp! instance, just download the content of this repository,

### Configuration

If you want to change some parameters, such as the Overpass API server or the available tile servers,
just edit the **config.json** file. You can also change the objects style by editing **style.json** file.
